## Search

[Check the main repo](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/CS50-Web-Compiled)

<p align="justify">This first project is a recreation of Google's CSS design, and also querying their search tool, so that my website behaves
exactly as Google's does.
It has one slight quirk that I never ironed out completely: When you hover above the search bar, the borders on it disappear, being replaced by a slight shadow below
the bar. However, this change causes the bar to move upwards a bit. <br>
My theory is that it's because the bar's adjusting automatically to the flex.
As the size of it changes slightly without the borders, it moves a bit. I have to fix that little detail.
